You love food. You like to try new things and experience different cultures. Now, with Your Inspiration at Home (YIAH), you can experience unique international flavours without leaving your kitchen. Enjoy the exact same meals as other families throughout the world, quickly and easily. We gather the globe around the same table with products you simply can’t find in a store or anywhere else.

Our all-natural seasonings, spices, salts and other items are inspired by ethnic regions and custom blended to make cooking fast, simple and healthy (with no added gluten, MSG or preservatives). To bring you your Passport to Authentic Flavour™, company founder and spice curator Colleen Walters travels the world for inspiration and personally develops every culturally-unique blend.

We introduce our ethnically-inspired creations to customers at fun “Tasting” parties where friends gather to eat terrific food, laugh, share recipes and learn how to easily prepare cultural dishes.

Friendly, professional Consultants attend the parties as “Flavour Guides” and will also offer YIAH products at personal website stores. We invite you to become an independent Consultant to discover how having fun and enjoying great food has its rewards.

Your Inspiration at Home began in Australia and now has Consultants in the UK, with ground–floor opportunities now available in America and New Zealand and soon to be in Canada. We’re crossing cultural barriers to make the world a smaller place through the magic of food. Join us on our journey.
